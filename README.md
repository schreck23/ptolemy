# ptolemy
A data processing engine that is designed to help with data onboarding within the Filecoin network.

Ptolemy will consist of a series of component designed to help process entire existing file structures and allow users to efficiently package data for delivery to Filecoin Storage Providers (from here on in referred to as SPs).  This allows to track and associate legacy filenames with CIDs, build car files of a configurable size and even invoke deals with deal engines on the network.
